# Project: Database Modelling with Apache Cassandra
Second project of the Data Engineering Nanodegree from Udacity. 

This project considers an imaginary startup called Sparkify which wants to analyze the data of its music streaming app to understand what songs their users are listening to. Unfortunately the startup has this data only within `csv` files and wants a better way to query it. 

To do so, in this project, an Apache Cassandra NoSQL database is created. This database is called ___ and consists of five tables: 

Following queries were considered when modelling the tables:

## Files
The project consists of following files:
- 

## Dependencies
To run the files following libraries (and its dependencies) are necessary:
- `pandas` - Manage dataframes to preprocess data
- `` - Connect to Apache Cassandra Database
